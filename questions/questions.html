<!-- I wanted to make a functional submission buttion, but I cannot seem to figure it out. It looks like I need a server that can use PHP. I do have such a server and I do not 
know how to use PHP. So I am hesitant to try something more advanced that I do not fully understand. Information can be inputted into the form and the alert pops up when the 
submit button is selected. The only issue is after pressing okay, it shows that my file cannot be accessed.-->
