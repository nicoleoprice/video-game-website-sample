<h2>Types of Designers</h2>
<!--The reasoning for choosing definitions over elaborate explanations are the same here as they are on the other career pages-->
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Game designers are the ones who come up with the rules of the game, what kind of game it will be, what is the goal of the game, and what the storyline
will be. Throughout the years, game design has become more specialized and now there are many different types of game designers. Here are some of those roles:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Content Designer</dt>
  <dd>This type of designer is involved in the world's narrative. They could write the story,
  character dialog, the missions, and in-game material such as books or writing on the wall.</dd>

<dt>Game Designer</dt>
  <dd>This type of game designer is a generalist who does not specialize in one particular designer role,
  but they can do some of the roles.</dd>

<dt>Game Writer</dt>
  <dd>Unlike content designers, game writers write about the story and the backstory. They sometimes
  can write the dialog, too.</dd>

<dt>Junior Designer</dt>
  <dd>A junior designer works under a senior designer in order to gain practical experience. It is an entry
  level position to get into game design in the gaming industry.</dd>

<dt>Lead Designer</dt>
<dd>This type of designer is in charge of managing the design team. Lead designers define the game's core and 
  feature set. They also can determine how the project is documented, overall story arc, and basic systems.</dd>

<dt>Level Designer</dt>
  <dd>This type of designer creates the level-by-level play in a game. This means that they create the level of
  difficulty for each level, map out where objects and characters will be placed in the world. This type of 
  designer is typically an artist and knows a little programming.<dd>
  
<dt>Senior Designer</dt>
  <dd>Senior designers are expected to be able to perform majority, if not all, of the responsibilities mentioned in 
  the other job descriptions. Although some senior designers do not know how to do level design.</dd>

<dt>System Designer</dt>
  <dd>This type of designer focuses on one specific system in the game. Some systems these designers focus on are fighting,
  crowd dynamics, avatar creation, leveling, or training. They could also focus on a smaller part of a system, such as 
  weapons, spells, or the types of characters a player can make.<dd>

<dt>Technical Designer</dt>
  <dd>Technical designers are a programmer-designer hybrid. They are responsible for implementing the gameplay. They are
  often in the between the design and programming departments.</dd>

<dt>UI Designer/Usability Expert</dt>
  <dd>This type of designer creates the interface of the game ensuring that the player and game can communicate well. They make sure
  that it is easy for the player to utilize the game and understand the commands.</dd>
