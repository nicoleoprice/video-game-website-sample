	is to turn off the lightbulbs. Whoever turns off the last light wins. It is a single player game against the computer where the player turns off ine or more lights in a single
	round then the computer takes a turn. It was widely popular st the time.</p>
	<!--I included Wiki pages to the inventors because this is a history of video games, not inventors. I did not want to deviate from the 
	topic of this page.-->
