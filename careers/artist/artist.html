<h1>Artist</h1>
<hr>
<!--I chose to do definitions instead of an extremely long explanation of each or the requirements to get into each of the fields because the skillset is quite similar, but I
think reading about what each role does is more interesting than how to get into each field without knowing much about them. This website is also a generalization about videogames,
not how to get into the field-->
<h2>Types of Artists</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different types of artists. All with different skillsets and 
use different software. The ones listed below are only a couple of the common ones.</p>
<dl>
<dt>2D/Texture Artists</dt>
  <dd>These artists create textures that can be applied to the things the 3D modellers make. This type of
  artist requires extensive knowledge in lighting, materials, perspective, and visual effects.</dd>

<dt>3D Modellers</dt>
  <dd>This type of artist will build characters, objects, and the environment with 3D modelling software. This includes life forms,
  scenery, furniture, plants, and more.</dd>

<dt>Concept Artist</dt>
  <dd>This type of artist sketches the ideas for the world of the game. They do not typically use software
  for their art, so it is usually a pen and paper. They sketch out ideas of everything ranging from characters to
  plants to clothing. Although their art is not displayed in the final product, they help create the foundations
  of the game.</dd>
  
<dt>Effects Artist</dt>
  <dd>This artist will work with both 2D and 3D software, particle systems and lights, to create lively effects.
  Some of the effects this artist will make are weather effects, water leaks, smoke, blowing dust, and more.</dd>

<dt>Environmental Artists</dt>
  <dd>This artist only works on the environment itself. They may do a variety of tasks, such as 3D modeling, work with complex layered
  shaders, simple animations, and texturing.</dd>

<dt>Lighting Artists</dt>
  <dd>This type of artist will place all of the lights in the game, adjust the color, adjust the intensity, and how
  the light falls off. This is an important job because it helps create the mood of the scenery and helps the world look more
  realistic.</dd>
