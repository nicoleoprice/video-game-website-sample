<h1>The Process of Making a Video Game</h1>
<hr>
<!--This section is based on what I have written for a paper in the previous class. I thought it would be a suitable webpage for this project-->

<h2>Pre-Production</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The making of a game begins with an idea. The team must decide what the game should be about, who the target audience will be, 
what the budget of the game is, and the art style of the game will be. Game designers are the foundation of the game production. 
A game designer, also called a developer, is someone who comes up with the rules of the game, storyline, characters, levels of difficulty, and dialogue. 
Once there is a clearer idea of what the game will be about, the game designers will draft a game design document (GDD). 
This organized document serves as a blueprint that outlines the major components of the game such as genre, mechanics, story, marketing strategy, and worldbuilding. 
Worldbuilding is creating the gaming world, what it will look like and what will be in it. 
This document will be continuously updated throughout the process adding new ideas from the first concepts. 
Finally, before moving to production, the game designers will team up with concept artists to draft the overall concept of the game. 
A concept artist will draw the initial sketches of the game in a storyboard format, that is in panels like a comic book. 
This concept art will be sent to the developers to create a prototype to see if the game can be fun for the audience.</p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The longest phase in the process, can take years. Creation of characters, game world, and objects. 
Many different people, all with important jobs, come together to bring the game into fruition. 
There is not a specific starting point since everyone is working on a particular task and will collaborate with others to make sure the game looks and functions as it should.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game artists can be characterized into smaller groups: animators, 3D artists, environmental artists, FX artists, and audio designers.
The animators, 3D artists, environmental artists, and FX (visual effects) artists are responsible for how the game will look. 
For example, how the characters will look, what kind of trees will be in the environment, will there be smoke or explosions included, 
how will the plants look when there is wind blowing, etc. Environmental artists create the habitats in the game. 
Will the game take place in a space shuttle or in the desert? These artists will recreate these immersive realms. 
The audio designers and audio engineers are responsible for the sounds in the game. 
They recreate the sounds of when a character steps on snow or sounds a creature would make and when those sounds would occur.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level designers are the ones who create the missions in the game and what each level will look like. 
They take the environments created by the artists and inspiration from the GDD to design believable missions in a game. 
A cowboy’s mission to fight a dragon would not make sense, but a cowboy’s quest to get rid of outlaws would be appropriate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game programmers are a vital element of the game production. Without these programmers, the game would not be playable. Game programmers code the game mechanics of the game. 
Such as when a certain soundtrack will play, whether a character can run or fly, and what graphics will appear in a specific location. Their job keeps the game running smoothly.</p>
	<p>Once the game is close to being finished with the combined efforts of the entire team, the game is moved into the post-production phase.</p>

<h2>Post Production</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the game is released, it needs to be marketed and tested. A quality assurance tester, or QA tester, is also commonly known as a game tester. 
Game testers test the game and report bugs to the programmers to be corrected. A bug can be a glitch or an error in the game where the game is not behaving the way it is 
supposed to. Playing a game is different from testing a game. The game tester does not play the game from start to finish but will repeat the various motions in a segment of 
the game to see if it is working properly. It can be as simple as entering a door several times from different angles or as complex as ensuring that the sequence of buttons 
to active one action is working properly. Game testers sometimes can test the game during the production phase, but this role is frequently extended into post-production and 
even after the game is released because nowadays, games can be continuously updated through the internet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a game is ready to be released to buyers, it is marketed to bring attention to the new game. Without publishers, the game would be unknown to the public and the company
 would not make any money. Publishers are those who are in charge of the business side, including marketing and budgeting, of the game. They create the advertisements, such as video
 game trailers, posters, and promotions, to attract the target audience and potentially reach out to those outside of that demographic. After the initial release, minor bugs are
 fixed and another cycle of a new game begins.</p>
