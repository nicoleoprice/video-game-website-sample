<h2>Types of Producers</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A general role of a producer is to deal with management, planning, commissioning,
and funding game projects. There are two different types of producers in the gaming industry.</p>

<dl>
<dt>External Producer</dt>
  <dd>This type of producer works with the publishing company rather than the developers. They are involved in
  commissioning games towards release. Instead of being involved in day-to-day business activities, they approve of 
  milestones, managing payment schedules to developers, and organizing quality assurance within the publishing company.</dd>
  
<dt>Internal Producer</dt>
  <dd>This type of producer works within the game studio as managers of the team. They are the boss of project management,
  costs, and issues with human resources. Some studios have a separation between the producer and game director roles &lpar;where
  the producer does not have a creative role&rpar;, while other studios have the producer as a creative lead.</dd>
