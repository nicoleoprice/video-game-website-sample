<!--Obviously none of this information is my own or "common knowledge," so that is why I created a Sources page. I thought it would look sloppy if I included sources on every single
web page. I think it being in one collective place helps. Also, some of the resource information overlaps, such as in Making a Game and some of the careers, so it could be useful
for those to be in the same place. -->
