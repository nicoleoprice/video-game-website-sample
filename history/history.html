  <h3>Nimatron</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the very first video games that existed was Nimatron, or Nim for short. Nim was invented by <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Condon">Edward U. Condon</a>. The premise of the game
	is to turn off the lightbulbs. Whoever turns off the last light wins. It is a single player game against the computer where the player turns off ine or more lights in a single
	round then the computer takes a turn. It was widely popular st the time.</p>
	<!--I included Wiki pages to the inventors because this is a history of video games, not inventors. I did not want to deviate from the 
	topic of this page.-->

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late 1940's, another game by the name of &ldquo;<i>Cathode Ray Tube Amusement Device</i>&rdquo; was patented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_T._Goldsmith_Jr.">
	Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr.</a> and Estle Ray Mann. This device is considered one of the first interactive computer games.
	In this game, the player points a beam from the cathode ray tube at a screen that has an overlay of different targets. The object of the game is to shoot the targets 
	by pressing a button.</p>
