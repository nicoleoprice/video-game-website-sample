<h1>Types of Gaming</h1>
<hr>
  <h2>PC Gaming</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal Computer Gaming, or PC Gaming, is the process of playing a video game on a computer, which can be a desktop or a laptop.</p>
  
  <h2>Console Gaming</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Console Gaming is the process of playing a video game on a system that displays a visual on screen and allows the player to move around with a controller or joy-stick.<p>
		
<!--Since this assignment requires at least one table, I felt that it was appropriate to include it here because there are many different types of consoles that would be easier
to express in table form instead of in paragraph form -->

  <h2>VR/AR Gaming</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Virtual Reality Gaming, or VR Gaming, is first-person gaming where the player is immersed into the game and typically requires physical movement to move the character. For
   example, a player might have to move their leg to kick a ball in the game. On the other hand, Augmented Reality Gaming, or AR Gaming, is gaming where digital influences 
   are added to real life. A great example of this is the game "Pokemon GO." An image of the gameplay is pictured below.</p>
